## Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a Senior Lecturer in Computing at [Leeds Beckett University](https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk). I specialise in teaching Software Engineering, from Programming, through to Processes. This does lead on to working on the business side of software, which could probably be summarised using a handy buzzword like *Digital Transformation*.

My distant background is in applying technology in Engineering, specifically manufacturing. This has now metamorphosed into thinking about what the world of Software Engineering can (and is) learning from manufacturing. It goes a bit further than Kanban. I should probably say *DevOps* at this point. My favourite book is [The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-phoenix-project/).

My second favourite book is one I wrote myself: [Yet Another Python Book](https://www.tony-jenkins.org.uk/pybook/). The source code for that is in a repo round here: [The Hungarian Phrasebook](https://github.com/TonyJenkins/hungarian_phrasebook). It changes every year, usually in the summer.

Before landing at LBU I worked for a small software company over in Huddersfield, managing their recruitment and training. I also did some teaching at the very close by (and very useful for recruitment) [University of Huddersfield]([https://www.hud.ac.uk/](https://www.hud.ac.uk/subjects/computer-science/)). Before that I spent a long time (too long, probably) at what we think of as [the University Down The Road](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing). I liked Huddersfield more.

The rumours that I once worked for a Brewery are true.

Most of the code in these repos will be in [Python](https://www.python.org/). Web apps will therefore be using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com). There might also be some PHP (which will be Laravel), but I am trying to forget that experience. And possibly some Java (needs must) that might well use Spring Boot. I really want to get some COBOL in here at some point - there should be more of it about.

I am strongly allergic to Microsoft Windows, although I do have a grudging respect for a business that can make so much money out of a product that is so poor.

*greetings@tony-jenkins.org.uk* will find me.
